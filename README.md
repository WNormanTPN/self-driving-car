## Introduction

This deep learning model uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to predict steering angles and speed for the self-driving car simulation: [Udacity Self-Driving Car Simulator](https://github.com/udacity/self-driving-car-sim). The model takes input from the car's 3 cameras (left, center, and right) and makes predictions for the car's movement.

- **Car Movement**: The car can move left (‚Üê), right (‚Üí), accelerate (‚Üë), and decelerate (‚Üì).
- **Camera Setup**: The car is equipped with three cameras (left, center, right).

<br>
<br>

## Prerequisites

- **Operating System**: Linux or Windows (Linux preferred)
- **Python**: 3.12.7
- **Simulation App**: [Udacity Self-Driving Car Simulator](https://github.com/udacity/self-driving-car-sim)

<br>

## Data Preparation

### Manual Data Collection:
1. Open the simulator and select the **Training Mode**.

</div>

2. Click on **Record**, choose a folder to save the data, and drive the car for about **10 minutes**.
   - Driving for 10 minutes will yield around **18,000 images** (6,000 images from each camera).

### Download Pre-recorded Data:
- **[Coming Soon]**

<br>

After data collection, you will have a `driving_log.csv` file, which contains information about the collected data:

| Image Path | Center Camera Image | Left Camera Image | Right Camera Image | Steering Angle | Throttle | Brake |
|------------|---------------------|-------------------|--------------------|----------------|----------|-------|

### Data Preprocessing
For Manual Data Collection Only.

## Usage

### [Coming Soon]

Once the model is trained, you can use it to predict the car's movements based on the camera input in the simulator.
